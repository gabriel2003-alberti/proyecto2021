			<p>Breakdance has several skills you can develop, choose the skill you want to learn about:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMhTaatkbLc">Toprocks:</a><br><br>

				These are the movements you do while you're standing. You can just learn a few toprocks, and try to add variations, since what makes the toprocks look visual is when you give them your own style being creative.</li><br><br>

				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veqDzSiqhes">Footworks:</a><br><br>

				These are the movements you do in a lower level. There are a lot of footworks you can learn, but as you do with toprocls, try to look for variations of these footworks, changing directions and combining it with other steps of toprocks, varying the height.</li><br>

				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us_xmJBTfOk">Freezes:</a><br><br>

				These are the movements you do when the music stops, to "freeze" yourself along with the music. Looking for variations in freezes is harder than with footworks or toprocks, but you can still do it. Freezes are harder to master and you have to dedicate some good amount of time to them, but once you have five freezes, you can start going from one freeze to another and come back. This will give you strength and more control over your freezes and footworks too.</li><br><br>
				
				<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5Xr0F4a0iU">Powermoves:</a><br><br>

				These movements are the most energrtic and impressive; but also the hardest ones. You can barely add original variations since the variations themselves are other different powermoves, but you can practice them all! You have to dedicate a lot of time to powermoves, as only one powermove can take you years to completely master it. Powermoves will also give you a lot of strength and control over your body, and over the footworks too, making them more powerful and smoother.</li><br>

			<h3>Breakdance</h3>

		<p>Breakdance is a dance born in the early 70s in the United States that, later, would expand to the rest of the world. It mainly consists, as we mentioned before, of four principal skills: Toprock, footwork, freezes and powermoves. </p>
